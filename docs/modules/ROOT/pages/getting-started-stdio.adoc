= Getting Started with STDIO Transport

include::includes/attributes.adoc[]
:diataxis-type: tutorial

This tutorial guides you through creating your first MCP server using the STDIO transport.
It uses Quarkus native compilation to create an MCP server that runs as a native executable with fast startup times.

== What You'll Build

You'll create a simple MCP server that:

* Exposes a tool to greet users
* Runs as a native executable
* Communicates via STDIO transport

== Prerequisites

* JDK 17 or later
* Maven 3.9+ or Gradle
* Mandrel / GraalVM (for native compilation)

== Creating the Project

Create a new Quarkus project with the MCP STDIO extension:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:{quarkus-version}:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \
    -DprojectArtifactId=mcp-stdio-quickstart \
    -Dextensions="io.quarkiverse.mcp:quarkus-mcp-server-stdio:{project-version}"
cd mcp-stdio-quickstart
----

== Creating Your First Tool

Create a simple greeting tool:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import io.quarkiverse.mcp.server.Tool;

public class GreetingTools {

    @Tool(description = "Greet a user by name")
    public String greet(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
----

That's it! The `@Tool` annotation automatically registers this method as an MCP tool.

== Building a Native Executable

Build a native executable for optimal performance:

[source,bash]
----
mvn package -Dnative
----

The native executable will be created in the `target` directory.

== Testing Your MCP Server with the MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is a handy tool for testing MCP servers.
Follow the instructions from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector[MCP Inspector] to download and run it.

Open the MCP Inspector in your browser (use the link with the token shown in the console) and configure it to connect to your native executable using STDIO transport.
In the server configuration, set the command to the absolute path of your native executable (e.g., `/path/to/mcp-stdio-quickstart/target/mcp-stdio-quickstart-1.0.0-runner`).

Once connected, you can list the tools exposed by the server and invoke the `greet` tool:

Congratulations! You've successfully invoked your first MCP tool!
You can now extend your server by adding more tools, prompts, and resources, and connect it to any MCP-compatible client (like Claude or Cursor).
